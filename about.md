I am currently attending South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SD Mines) in Rapid City, SD and pursuing a degree track that will result in a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in May of 2021 and a M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in May of 2022.  My commitment to academic excellence has produced a 3.87 GPA for all SD Mines coursework and placement on the Deanâ€™s List.  During the summer of 2019 I successfully completed a Software Engineering internship at Moog Space and Defense in Golden, CO.  My background is diverse and includes a B.A. in English from Colorado State University and a three-year stretch in the automotive industry as a Master Certified Technician.
