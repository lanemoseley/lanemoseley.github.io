I am currently working as a year-round Software Engineer Intern at Moog Space & Defense and pursing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SD Mines). I also plan to complete a M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering while at SD Mines. My commitment to academic excellence has produced a 3.82 GPA for all SD Mines coursework and placement on the Deanâ€™s List. My background is diverse and includes a B.A. in English from Colorado State University and a three-year stretch in the automotive industry as a Master Certified Technician.
