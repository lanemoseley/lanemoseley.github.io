I am currently attending SD School of Mines and pursuing a degree track that will result in a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in December of 2020 and a M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering in December of 2021. Last summer I completed a software engineering internship at Moog Space & Defense in Golden, CO. This summer, I am interning at Amazon Web Services.
   
I did not find my passion for programming right away.  My past experience includes a B.A. in English from Colorado State University and a stint as an auto mechanic. While working as an auto mechanic I taught myself Python and haven't looked back since.
   
When not in front of a screen, I enjoy skiing, mountain biking, and sunshine. Cheers!<br/><br/>
